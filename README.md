# jekyll-skeleton #

Super simple implementation of [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com) as a Jekyll theme.

## Why? ##

I got tired of heavy CSS frameworks (Bootstrap & Foundation) being large downloads and getting in my way of customizing my blog.
I know you can select only the components you want from each of these and throw away others, but that seemed like the opposite direction than I wanted to work from.

## Installation ##

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-skeleton"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-skeleton
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-skeleton

This will give you some simple, basic layouts (nothing fancy) and the basic CSS.
It's just a skeleton, after all ;)
